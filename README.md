A package for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) that skips extra closing quotes as you type HTML/XML tag attributes.

When you type a closing quote after an attribute value, if there was already a closing quote, it will be deleted. This prevents you from having to use the right arrow key to get out of the attribute and continue typing.
